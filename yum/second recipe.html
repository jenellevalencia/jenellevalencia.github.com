        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>2 pkg yeast, dissolved in 1 cup lukewarm water </li>
  <li>6 T of shortening </li>
  <li>1 cup sugar </li>
  <li>7 cups unbleached all purpose flour or more as needed (it will take more) </li>
  <li>2 cups hot water </li>
  <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
  <li>1 T salt </li>
  <li>Softened butter </li>
  <li>Brown sugar </li>
  <li>Raisins </li>
  <li>Cinnamon </li>
  </ul>
      <h2>For The Frosting</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>butter</li>
  <li>Vanilla</li>
  <li>Powdered Sugar</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  </ul>
          <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Add yeast to cup of lukewarm water and sprinkle in a little sugar. Set aside for about five minutes.</li>
  <li>Add shortening, sugar, and salt to hot water and cool to lukewarm. Stir in 2 cups of flour and mix until smooth. Add yeast and mix again until smooth. Add in beaten eggs.</li>
  <li>Stir in remainder of flour, a little at a time until no more can be mixed in. Remove the mixer attachment and knead by hand, adding flour until dough does not stick to the bowl. Remove from bowl and knead until dough feels satiny and looks smooth.</li>
  <li>Cover and let rise for 30 minutes. Lightly knead and roll out into rectangular shape. Spread with softened butter. Sprinkle on brown sugar, raisins, and cinnamon. (make sure you use LOTS of brown sugar...you can omit the raisins, but my family loves them, and sprinkle on loads of cinnamon. we never measure but be very generous.)</li>
  <li> Roll into one long roll. To cut use a piece of string or floss.</li>
  <li>Place on well greased pans and let rise until double in bulk. Bake at 425 degrees for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake until brown-only about 5-7 more minutes.</li>
    <li>Make the frosting. I am not sure on the amount! My dad just guesses! Whisk until you get the right consistency and frost the rolls! Frost the cooled cinnamon rolls generously!</li>
